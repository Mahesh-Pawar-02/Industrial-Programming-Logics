/*  Problem statement : Create one typescript application which contains one class named as Arithematic.
    Arithematic class contains three characteristic ( class Data members ) as Number1, Number2.
    In Arithematic class we have to write four methods (Behaviours) as Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division.
    
    1. Addition method will add Number1, Number2 & return result.
    2. Substraction method will subtract Number1, Number2 & return result.
    3. Multiplication method will multiply Number1, Number2 & return result.
    4. Division method will Divide Number1, Number2 & return result.

    After designing yje class create two objects of that class by providing some hardcoded value.
